    You will shortly receive an invite to our organization's Slack channel, if you have not been invited already. This is where we collaborate and schedule classes.
    Each shop has a Resource Manager for conducting checkouts and maintaining the workshop. 
    If there are any shops or equipment that you are particularly interested getting checked out on, please reach out to the respective Resource Manager for more details on checkouts. 
    Each shop has their own Slack channel for this purpose.
