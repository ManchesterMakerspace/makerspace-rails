```


# Testing
Rspec is used for unit testing the ruby backend.

$ rspec

Emails in the development environment are published to MailTrap under the adgrants@ user in Lastpass. To preview emails, you can view them in the browser by starting a server with `TEST_MAIL=true rails s`; this will start a development server, which will preview emails, using a test database to hydrate values for all the mocks. If you need to test that the emails actually sent, you may use `MAILTRAP_API_TOKEN` environment variable in the development environment. 

# Swagger
An OpenSwagger spec of the JSON API can be generated or updated with `rake rswag:specs:swaggerize`. To view an interactive version of this swagger, start a development server with `rails s` and navigate to `/api-docs`
